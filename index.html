        <h3>What comes next?<h3>
<p>First of all, open-source replication of o3, facilitated by the ARC Prize competition in 2025, will be crucial to move the research community forward. A thorough analysis of o3's strengths and limitations is necessary to understand its scaling behavior, the nature of its potential bottlenecks, and anticipate what abilities further developments might unlock.

Moreover, ARC-AGI-1 is now saturating – besides o3's new score, the fact is that a large ensemble of low-compute Kaggle solutions can now score 81% on the private eval.

We're going to be raising the bar with a new version – ARC-AGI-2 - which has been in the works since 2022. It promises a major reset of the state-of-the-art. We want it to push the boundaries of AGI research with hard, high-signal evals that highlight current AI limitations.</p>

Our early ARC-AGI-2 testing suggests it will be useful and extremely challenging, even for o3. And, of course, ARC Prize's objective is to produce a high-efficiency and open-source solution in order to win the Grand Prize. We currently intend to launch ARC-AGI-2 alongside ARC Prize 2025 (estimated launch: late Q1).

Going forward, the ARC Prize Foundation will continue to create new benchmarks to focus the attention of researchers on the hardest unsolved problems on the way to AGI. We've started work on a third-generation benchmark which departs completely from the 2019 ARC-AGI format and incorporates some exciting new ideas.
